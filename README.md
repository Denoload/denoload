# ðŸ¦• `denoload` - Load testing scenarios in minutes.

Denoload is a modern load testing tool that empower your Web API load tests 
with Client Libraries using JavaScript and [Deno][deno].

It is strongly inspired by [k6][k6].

## Why ?

[k6][k6] is a great tool but it's lacking of libraries and community due to its
custom JavaScript VM and API. Worse, there are edge cases where the VM isn't
standard and can not be. This can lead to a **lot** frustration.

Denoload aims to be an alternative with:
- great performance (comparable to [k6][k6])
- write [k6][k6] like scripts with VU & executors
- web APIs, you can use your client libraries.
- ESModules support
- Modern JavaScript & TypeScript support out of the box (including `async` /
  `await`)

This project is based on [Deno][deno] to provide the best DX experience out of
the box.

## Limitations

Each worker (and therefor thread) handle a single VUs until [Shadow Realms](https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/13239)
are implemented.
