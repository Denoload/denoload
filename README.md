# ðŸ¦• `denoload` - Accelerate web API load testing with seamless client library integration.

`denoload` is a versatile load testing tool engineered to simplify the load
testing of web services and similar backend components. It seamlessly integrate
with client libraries, empowering developers to create robust load tests in just
minutes. With `denoload`, you can verify the performance of your web services
under real-world conditions, all while enjoying a straightforward and efficient
testing process.

It is strongly inspired by [k6][k6].

## Why ?

[k6][k6] is a great tool but it's lacking of libraries and community due to its
custom JavaScript VM and API. Worse, there are edge cases where the VM isn't
standard and can not be. This can lead to a **lot** frustration.

`denoload` aims to be an alternative with:
- great performance (comparable to [k6][k6])
- write [k6][k6] like scripts with VUs, iterations and executors
- web APIs, you can use your client libraries.
- ESModules support
- Modern JavaScript & TypeScript support out of the box (including `async` /
  `await`)

This project is based on [Bun][bun].

## Limitations

Cookies are not supported.

## Why `denoload` ?

The project was originally based on the [Deno](https://deno.land) runtime but I
switched to [Bun][bun] for better performance and [isolation](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-shadowrealm/).
